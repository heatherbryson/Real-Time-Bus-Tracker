# Real Time Bus Tracker
This moduele worked with asynchronous code. For this project we got to familiarize ourselves with API keys and using them to source real time data.

To play click the "show stops" button to see the bus stops between MIT and Harvard.

## How to Run
Have all three files downloaded to your computer and run the index.html file from your local browser.

## Future improvements
Later on I would like to add real time stamps to the stops with stagnent markers.

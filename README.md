# Real Time Bus Tracker
This project shows you the current bus stops between MiT and Harvard placed with moving map markers when you click the button. I've added some still markers to show where the stops are after the map is done with its animation.
Future improvements that could be made to this are adding timestamps to show an actual schedule of the bus

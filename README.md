# Real Time Bus Tracker
This moduele worked with asynchronous code. For this project we got to familiarize ourselves with API keys and using them to source real time data

## How to Run
Click the "show stops" button to see the bus stops between MiT and Harvard

##Future improvements
Later on I would like to add real time stamps to the stops with stagnent markers.
